# Cost-effective-path-optimisation

The project works on finding the most cost effective path for a service or delivery based system.
Basically finding the solution of the travelling salesman problem with different algorithm and comparing the time complexity.

The work is done on cpp considering branch & bound and Dynammic programming and the time complexity of both the systems is analysed to find the best solution.
