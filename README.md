# Cost-effective-path-optimisation

The project works on finding the most cost effective path for a service or delivery based system.
Basically finding the solution of the travelling salesman problem with different algorithm and comparing the time complexity.

The work is done on cpp considering branch & bound and Dynammic programming and the time complexity of both the systems is analysed to find the best solution.
Another method is considered for solving the problem and its analysis has been done.

the files contain:
1)solution by branch and bound
2)solution by dynamic programming
3) Analysis report
